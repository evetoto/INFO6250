For assignment review
*New Update*

For assignment6, it is a sign up and log in experience to user. This app have mainpage, signup page and login page, user can choose signup and login in mainpage. In each page, user need to fill some information. After that, user can go to chat page. Also if user log in before, he can go to chat page when he return log in page. Because it has cookie to store user's information. 



hw5 + controller.js are for Assignment5. But I have problem about connection. Both Set and get can not working. So I did not upload them to vm. It always shows that: 
"Uncaught Predis\Connection\ConnectionException: php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known [tcp://redis-master:6379] in /usr/share/php/Predis/Connection/AbstractConnection.php:155" 
I still work on that.

hw3 + app.js are for Assignment3. Because we just learned MVC concept, base on what I did in hw2, I seperate the controller from the view part. app.js is the controller, hw3 is the view part.

hw2 is for Assignment2. I created a sign up page with print function in a http file.
