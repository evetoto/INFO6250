For assignment review


hw3 + app.js are for Assignment3. Because we just learned MVC concept, base on what I did in hw2, I seperate the controller from the view part. app.js is the controller, hw3 is the view part.

hw2 is for Assignment2. I created a sign up page with print function in a http file.
