For assignment review

hw5 + controller.js are for Assignment5. But I have problem about connection. Both Set and get can not working. It always shows that: 
"Uncaught Predis\Connection\ConnectionException: php_network_getaddresses: getaddrinfo failed: Name or service not known [tcp://redis-master:6379] in /usr/share/php/Predis/Connection/AbstractConnection.php:155" 
I still work on that.

hw3 + app.js are for Assignment3. Because we just learned MVC concept, base on what I did in hw2, I seperate the controller from the view part. app.js is the controller, hw3 is the view part.

hw2 is for Assignment2. I created a sign up page with print function in a http file.
